This is a easy to use and simple diary webapp which coded using typescript, HTML, Java. The user has to signup for an account and use that credentials to login. Once you were inside you can use it like your normal diary webapp. You can add events, create diary entries, toggle theme and so on. You can clear the diary entries by going to settings tab. There are lot more features you can experience in it. This is still a prototype and it's not advised for daily use. Right now the login process is at it's beginner phase. So you can simply signup by entering random information. And it doesn't store information permanently.
